Environ
   |
   ---> Environ()	# The constructor function for the Environ object.
   |
   |
   |	# Build the dendogram for comparing structures.
   ---> dendogram(matrix_file,	# Alignment matrix.
   |			  cluster_cut)	# Cutoff value.
   |
   |	# libs is a member class of Environ class. topology and parameters are member classes of libs class.
   ---> libs.topology.read(file)	# Read the topology.	
   |
   ---> libs.parameters.read(file)	# Read the parameters.
   |
   |
   ---> io.atom_file_directory		# io is another member class in Environ class. atom_file_directory is clearly one of io class' attribute.

Model
  |	   # The default constructor function of the Model class.
  ---> Model(env,				# The environment object.
  |   		 file_format,		# File format such as PDB.
  |			 model_segment)		# Start and end of segment. This argument ensures that only one chain is used.
  |
  |	   # Another constructor function.
  ---> complete_pdb(env,		# The environment object.
  					pdb_file	# The molecular structure file in PDB format.


Automodel
	|
	|	# The constructor function for the Automodel class.
	---> Automodel(enviorment,		# The environemtn object.
	|			  align_file,		# Both the template and query sequence in PIR format, in one file.
	|			  known,			# The template protein's PDB id.
	|			  sequence,			# The query protein - acc. ID used.
	|			  assess_method		# Scores from various asses methods, input as a tuple.
	|
	---> make()		# Function that actually calculates the model based on all the input.
	|
	|
	---> starting_model	# start_model and end_model are two iterator index attribute of the Automodel class.
	|					# start_model is the starting index, end_model is the ending index.
