Prepare the sequence
--------------------
1. Download the FASTA format of the query sequence and rename the file and FASTA identifier if necessary.

2. The first line of the .ali file contains the P1 code followed by the sequence identifier (also called sequence code), a bit like the .fasta files.

3. The P1 code syntax:

			>P1; [Protein name] [Other description, say from the FASTA GI]

   This [protein name] is used in all the modeller script as ALIGN_CODE. Slight mismatch and modeller will through error (discussed in the note bellow).


4. The second line of the .ali file must contain alignment directive. This directive consists of 10 different fields seperated by ':'. In the current example,
   only 2 of this 10 fields are specified. The keyword "sequence" in the first field says that its a sequence without known structure. The second field contains
   the sequence identifier. The complete 2nd line in the example looks like:

   		sequence:query_grp40:::::::0.00: 0.00

4. Every standard amino acid residue must be uppercase letter.

5. The end of sequence must be marked with '*'. So the last line of the sequence will look like:

		......................ITGAWSVVLNPLVTGYLGRGPGLKTVCAARTQGGKSQK*

Note: modeller is very sensitive to the syntax of the line containing the P1 code. Any deviation from this syntax - say writing "> P1;" or ">p1 ;" instad of
">p1;" and modeller will fail to recognize the .ali file and return the errors:

		$ Protein specified in ALIGN_CODES(i) was not found in the alignment file; ALIGN_CODES( 1) = ALL

Although looks enigmatic and unspecific, its clear from the error msg that modeller won't allow a single bit of anomany in the .ali file :p
