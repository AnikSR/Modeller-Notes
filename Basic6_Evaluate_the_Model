modeller generates a plethora of parameters concering both the template and the model. However, a basic evaluation based on DOPE score and GA341 score can be
done by:

1. Evaluate the model using evaluate_model.py script.

2. Evaluate the template using evaluate_template.py script.

3. Plot both these using plot_profiles.py. A significant deviation of the model from the template means the models is bust.


Again, automated search and replace the model and template name is the easiest way to dress the python scripts for specific template/query model.
