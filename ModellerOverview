File types modeler works on
---------------------------
.ali 		- Alignment file, this is the input.
.py			- The python script.
.prf		- PICS Rules File - output of sequence alignment.
.pap		- Output file for structural alignment.
.txt/.log	- Workflow log.
.pdb		- Output modeled protein.
.PIR		- Protein Information Repository. This is the database against which sequence alignment will be performed.
.bin		- The binary form of .PIR, this will be used for acutal alignment.

Protein Information Repository database is available in two forms - pdb_95.PIR and pdball.PIR

pdb_95.PIR - Protein is clustered by 95% identity.
pdball.PIR - All the pdb file.

Updated version of both of these *.PIR files are available in Modeller website (saillab.org/modeller/) under the "Data file download" menu.


Workflow: Basic
---------------
1. Collect and prepare the sequence of the protein in question.

2. Prepare/modify the script file to run MSA against the curated protein database and build the profile of query sequence.

3. Select the template: make the initial selection, compare the templates in initial selection among them, and select the final template to model against.

4. Align the query sequence with the tentative template sequence.

5. Build model using AutoModel() function.

6. Evaluate model by graphing the energy parameters of the template and the modeled structure.
